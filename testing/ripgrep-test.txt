#Tested the grep-it.sh script with ripgrep compared to gnu grep:
#ripgrep is an alternative for grep https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep that can be used instead
#a couple regex will fail with ripgrep, most will work
#when I last checked two failed, one with ?! (negative look around) and one with argument -o
#Test with some disassembled and decompiled Android apps on a quad core machine:
#gnu grep without BACKGROUND: real 5m25.681s (gnu grep on OSX on 1 core) VS real 2m7.955s (ripgrep on OSX on 4 cores)
#gnu grep with 4 MAX_PROCESSES and BACKGROUND: real 2m18.764s (gnu grep on OSX on 4 cores) VS real 2m7.955s (ripgrep on OSX on 4 cores)
#and that overhead of gnu grep is probably only because we have a sleep 0.25 when BACKGROUND is enabled!
#We could lower that to 0.1 or something, but I'm not convinced it's worth the overhead
#therefore it seems it has only little/no benefit for us
